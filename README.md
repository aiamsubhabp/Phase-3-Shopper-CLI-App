# PROJECT NAME HERE
## CLI Description 
- This project features a command line interface (CLI), which is an interactive script that prompts the user and performs operations based on the user input.
- This project includes two models, the Manufacturer model and the Product model.  
    - There exists a one to many relationship between the two models; the manufacturer is the one, and the products are the many. In other words one manufacturer can produce many products, but each product can only be associated with one manufacturer. For instance, Apple produces many products such as iPhones, Airpods, etc.; however, iPhones and Airpods can only be produced by Apple. 

## Manufacturer Model

## Roadmap
- add MSRPs to each product so that shoppers can compare prices
